Difficulties:
I had trouble with handling the window and saving it to a scriptable object. I acidentally put all my scripts
in the editor folder which took a minute to sort out. But in the end, I was able to put something together.

If I had more time, I would add a field to reference the next dialogue object to load, to support a chain
of dialogues.
